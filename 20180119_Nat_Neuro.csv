Article,15 January 2018,Grid scale drives the scale and long-term stability of place maps,"How entorhinal grid cells control hippocampal coding and behavior remains elusive. The authors report that increasing the spatial scale of grid cells expands the scale and reduces the stability of place fields, impairing spatial memory in mice."
Technical Report,15 January 2018,In vivo simultaneous transcriptional activation of multiple genes in the brain using CRISPRâ€“dCas9-activator transgenic mice,dCas9-mediated activation has been verified and widely used in vitro. Here the authors generated a potent in vivo activation platform and applied it to control the transcription of multiple genetic elements in the mammalian brain.
Resource,15 January 2018,Conserved properties of dentate gyrus neurogenesis across postnatal development revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing,"Using single-cell RNA-seq, the authors show that early developmental neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is largely conserved in the adult, but with a perinatal transformation of stem cells to an adult type."
Article,15 January 2018,Dietary salt promotes neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction through a gut-initiated TH17 response,A salt-rich diet promotes cerebrovascular diseases and dementia. This study shows that high dietary salt in mice induces a TH17 response in the gut leading to cerebral endothelial dysfunction and cognitive impairment via circulating IL-17.
Article,15 January 2018,Dentate network activity is necessary for spatial working memory by supporting CA3 sharp-wave ripple generation and prospective firing of CA3 neurons,Sasaki et al. reveal that the dentate gyrus not only performs pattern separation but also has a direct role in organizing memory-guided behavior by coordinating the planning of future actions.
Article,15 January 2018,N6-methyladenosine RNA modification regulates embryonic neural stem cell self-renewal through histone modifications,"Using a genetic approach, Wang et al. demonstrate an essential function for m6A mRNA modification in promoting neural stem cell proliferation and reveal interactions between m6A and histone modification as a novel gene regulatory mechanism."
